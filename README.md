# ESPHome KM271-WiFi

This repo is the ESPhome project page of my KM271-WiFi hardware.

The KM271-WiFi is an addon to the (oldish) Buderus oil heating control units like the Logamatic 2107.

More details can be found on my [blog](https://the78mole.de/reverse-engineering-the-buderus-km217/) or the [project page](https://the78mole.de/projects/km271-wifi-howto/).

The hardware itself is available on [tindie](https://www.tindie.com/products/24664/).

The repo for the esphome component has a [seperate repo](https://github.com/the78mole/esphome_components).
